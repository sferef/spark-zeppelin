## Spark compatibility
`
Spark runs on Java 8/11, Scala 2.12, Python 3.6+ and R 3.5+. Java 8 prior to version 8u92 support is deprecated as of Spark 3.0.0. For the Scala API, Spark 3.1.2 uses Scala 2.12. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.12.x).

## Scala 2.12.8 Not recomended 

This release fixes two regressions that appeared in 2.12.7:

Don't reject views with result types which are TypeVars (#7295)
Don't emit static forwarders (which simplify the use of methods in top-level objects from Java) for bridge methods (#7469)
The second fix is not binary compatible: the 2.12.8 compiler omits certain methods that are generated by earlier 2.12 compilers. However, we believe that these methods are never used and existing compiled code will continue to work. See the pull request description for more details.

Further highlights of this release:

The license was changed to Apache v2.0 (#7314)
Improved inference of parameter types for eta-expansion (#7340)
Emit detailed compiler trace under -Yprofile-trace (#7364)
Make the compiler output deterministic under incremental compilation (#7203)
For more details, check out all closed bugs and merged PRs.

As usual for minor releases, Scala 2.12.8 is binary compatible with the whole Scala 2.12 series.
